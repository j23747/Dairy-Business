          <h3>We Provide Fresh, Pure Raw Milk for Your Family</h3>
          <p>We believe that fresh, clean raw milk is one of the most wholesome and nutrient dense foods that you could offer your family.</p>
          <p>For over 10,000 years people have enjoyed the wide array of milk products, including fresh milk, buttermilk, clabber, curds, whey and a variety of cheeses. Never were these products pasteurized.</p>
          <p>Over the past 70 years, Americans have been inundated with information about pasteurized milk that was incomplete. There was a time when pasteurization may have prevented certain pathogenic bacteria, introduced through poor handling techniques,
            from being transferred in the milk to the consumer. However, it was no absolute guarantee. The main success that pasteurization afforded the mass milk producers was a longer shelf life, resulting in higher profitability.</p>
